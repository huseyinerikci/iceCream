# 🍦 Ice Cream Project
This project is an ice cream ordering application built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. Users can browse various ice cream options, select either a cone or a cup, and add items to their cart. Within the cart, they can increase or decrease item quantities, remove items, and finalize their order. Once the order is confirmed, the cart is cleared, and a notification is displayed to the user.
